Welcome to my page üëè, I am a PhD candidate (2021-now) in the Department of Computer Science at [Durham University (UK)](https://www.dur.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/), supervised by Prof. [Hubert P. H. Shum](http://hubertshum.com/) and Dr. [Stamos Katsigiannis](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/stamos-katsigiannis/). My primary interests are deep learning, machine learning, and data analysis. Specifically, I utilize time-series analysis and graph neural network (GNN) techniques to address challenges in pedestrian and vehicle trajectory prediction, as well as human motion recognition in real-world scenarios. 

Prior to Durham University, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in **Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence** (2016-2019) and a Master of Science in **Advanced Computer Science (Data Analytics)** (2019-2020) from the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). I am deeply interested in the applications of time-series and spatial-temporal modeling in real-world scenarios, and I am committed to exploring cutting-edge research in these areas.

Outside of my research, I am passionate about music‚Äîplaying the piano, guitar, and singing‚Äîand I enjoy sports like snooker, football, and badminton.


I am also enthusiastic about participating in teaching (demonstration) activities at the university for the following modules:
* Postgraduate Module: Text Mining and Language Analytics
* Postgraduate Module: Learning from Data
* Postgraduate Module: Programming for Data Science
* 2nd Year Module: Data Science (Probability, Image Processing and Computer Graphics)
* 1st Year Module: Algorithms and Data Structures
